# ETDMods2CrossRef
Script to turn ETD MODS records into valid CrossRef XML in order to register DOIs


## How to Use

Put the etds.php and upload.php files on your local or hosted webserver.

Start with upload.php, which gives you a form to select a MODS XML file. Once selected, click the submit button and the transformed, valid CrossRef XML file will be placed in the /output folder.

Then you can log in to CrossRef and upload the outputted file, which will register the DOI.

This script was built around the ETDS MODS format generated by Unversity Librarian Annie Glerum, and many variables are dependent on the infrastructure and workflows at FSU Libraries (like the PURL link).
